### Hi there 👋

I've been working as developer since 2006, today I work on web platform, and I love learn more about neural networks, IA, ML and data visualization.

When I'm not working i'm study some thing about machine learning, octave, rust, etc...

I use [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) on my zsh terminal. 
Some times I just walk on the streests take some pictures of oridinary peoples, I run three times every week,  
I spend sometimes read the news papers.

With my daughter, I play nintendo switch, we talk about planets, animals or how some thing works.
