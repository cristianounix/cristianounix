## Hi there 👋

I've been working as developer since 2006, today I work on web platform, and I love learn more about neural networks, IA, ML and data visualization.


I use [powerlevel10k](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k) on my zsh terminal. 
Some times I just walk on the streets take some pictures of ordinary people, I run three times every week,  
I spend sometimes read the news paper.

With my daughter, I play nintendo switch, we talk about planets, cartoon or movie the she's watching, animals or how some thing works.


When I'm not working i'm study some thing about machine learning, octave, rust, etc...
